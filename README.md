# Anomaly Detection in Electric Vehicle Charging

## Project Description

This project analyzes electric vehicle charging data and detects anomalies using machine learning models.

## Achievements

Loaded and preprocessed the dataset ev_charging_patterns.csv.

Explored data to identify relevant characteristics.

Applied and compared multiple anomaly detection algorithms:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- Angle-Based Outlier Detection (ABOD)

- Isolation Forest (IForest)

- One-Class SVM (OCSVM)

Visualized and interpreted the results.

## File Structure

- Tema1_Tia.ipynb - The main notebook containing the code for anomaly detection analysis.

- ev_charging_patterns.csv - The dataset used for analysis.
